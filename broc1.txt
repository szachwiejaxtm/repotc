[Verse 1: Ameer Vann] conti
My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up, I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does, and like my teachers would say:
"Little Black boys have a place in the world
Like hanging from trees, or dead in the street"
Like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies, I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark, I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave, gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb, refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey; see, your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money, don't care to cater to merit
Y'all fetishizing my spirit, I see your culture’s dependent
On what you didn’t inherit, won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant
